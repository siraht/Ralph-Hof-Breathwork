# Agent Notes

## Project Summary

- 2026-01-21: Plan to use local-first persistence (AsyncStorage + SQLite) for settings and session history; no backend in MVP.

- 2026-01-21: Set base navigation as bottom tabs with a Home stack and a light glacier palette using Space Grotesk + Space Mono typography.
